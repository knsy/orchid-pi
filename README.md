# orchid-pi
An automatic orchid watering system exploration. Far far back burner fun project.

## Idea
I need to keep my orchids alive when I leave for a month or 6 at a time and don't want to burden other people or don't trust them to take care.

## Current State
Right now it is at its' simplest. Just a timer that switches a relay that controls a pump based on a schedule. 

## Future
Eventually, I would like to integrate more sensors and control of the blinds so that the system would be fairly autonomous.


Further eventually, I'd like to use moisture/water sensors and have the system learn when/how much water to dispense since temperature fluctuates in the room and water requirements fluctuate with that temperature and season. Regression seems like a good candidate at the moment.


Side-eventuallys: Web interface for tracking any faults/emergencies(i.e. pump broke), camera feed to see general state of orchids/system, redundancies(multiple pumps to vary flow rates to different orchids and a fallback if one breaks)
